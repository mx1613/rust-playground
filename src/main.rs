    // MODULES
    // rust has its own module system. 
    // pieces of code can be namespaced into modules using the mod keyword.

    // entities in a module can be accessed using the :: operator.
    // entities within a module are private by default, but can be made public using the pub keyword.

    let favorite = is_favorite("Coconut");
    println!("{}", favorite);
    // rust also allows us to define more restricive pubs. 
    // pub(crate) makes an entity public to the current crate.
    // pub(super) makes an entity public to the current module.
    // pub(in path) makes an entity public to the current module and any child modules.
    // to navigate our modules, we can also use ::super and ::self, and ::crate.
    // ::super refers to the parent module.
    // ::self refers to the current module.
    // ::crate refers to the root module of the current crate.
    // just like in python, we can use the as keyword to rename a module or a type.

    // MACROS 
    // macros are similar to functions, but they can be used to define patterns.
    // macros are defined using the macro_rules! macro.
    // macros are expanded before the compiler interprets the code.
    // macros are often used to define DSLs.
    // macros can also be used to define attributes.
